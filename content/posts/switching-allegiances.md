summary: I don’t understand how it is that footballers can play an international friendly for one country, but would still be eligible to play for another in competitive matches.

Firstly, I don’t like that fact that players can qualify for multiple countries in the first place. You’re from where you’re from. The way we define that nowadays is much more flexible than it used to be, with multicultural and multi-national families meaning that a player can be born in one country, brought up in another country, have parents and grandparents of separate origins and as a result be eligible for 6 or more national football teams. I find that idea ludicrous.

Even more ludicrous is how someone can have such little affection for a country that they are willing to play for any nation that they may have a tenuous link to, just so they have the opportunity to play international football. The whole thing is a joke. You just have to look at the Welsh team to see that the majority of them were not born in Wales, have never lived in Wales, and only go to Wales to play international football.

I can _just about_ abide that. Although I do have to admit it feels really insincere, especially when you see videos of the Welsh team celebrating like mad when they watched England getting knocked out of Euro 2016.

What I can’t abide is the nation-jumping mentality. Actually, even the fact that it is possible to do that is really irritating to me. Once you have decided who you want to represent you shouldn’t be allowed to change your mind. I think players should be made to make that decision as soon as they sign their first professional contracts.

Until a player has made a competitive appearance for a country, they are still eligible to play for any other country that they are eligible to play for - if that makes sense. That means they can play international friendlies, and play competitive games all the way up through the age group teams.

When they do switch allegiances I think it shows how much certain players are in it for themselves these days, and they feel like their own personal success is more important than that of the team or the nation.

Look for example at the recent U17 world cup winners. I couldn’t be more excited and optimistic about the future of the England team, and I’m not saying any of them will jump ship to play for another country, but take the photo above as an example.

Every single one of them has turned their shirt around to tell the world what their name is, when they should be proudly showing off the lions on their chest. They won the tournament for England, not themselves. I get that they are starting out and might be looking to get themselves some exposure in order to get a move, but surely they realise scouts will watch their performances back and not just sign young players based on them being in a photo of a trophy presentation?

It’s really disappointing and takes a little of the shine off of the trophy they worked so hard and played so brilliantly to win.

Who knows whether these kids will go on to play for the senior team, or even if they will represent England at all. But the fact that they can win a trophy wearing England’s colours, but still be eligible to play in the senior World Cup for other nations leaves a really unpleasant taste in the mouth.
