title: Don't Panic Yet
date: 2019-09-18T08:42:33+01:00
draft: false
summary: 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats from the first 6 games for what is now a bang average Premier League team. But if there's any point in what seems to be a new transfer policy and direction, we need to stick with Ole now.

As far as starts to a season go, this has been pretty shocking from Man United. It doesn't take a genius to work that out. However it might take a genius to work out how we begin to get back to anything like the club we used to be.

The core fabric of everything that was United is either dying or dead. Today for the first West Ham goal I saw Nemanja Matic watch Mark Noble dribble slowly on the edge of the United box for a good 10 seconds without even the slightest hint of closing down. Noble had all the time in the world to pick a pass, which then led to the opening goal for West Ham.

We're talking about Mark Noble. We're not talking about Messi or De Bruyne or Bernardo Silva - players who would genuinely strike fear into defenders and cause them to back off. We're talking about Mark Noble.

As much as it saddens me to say it, I was half expecting the result today. United haven't always travelled very well to West Ham, who seem to be super pumped every time we play them, especially at the old Boleyn ground. When you look at our team on paper we are probably at about the same level as West Ham, Leicester and Everton.

After just two wins out of six to kick off the season, and only 5 wins in something like the last 19 league games it would be easy for the fans to start getting restless and knee-jerky, so that's exactly what they've done. #oleout was trending after the final whistle and I've seen video of YouTube "fan" channels asking for post match action from the board.

But that is the complete opposite of what we should be looking to do right now. I appreciate that it has now been six - and is guaranteed to be seven - years since we won the title. We've only finished second once since Fergie left. That's not good enough and I get it. But for the last six years the club have been trying to throw money at the problem, with the mindset that past-it marquee signings in combination with a managerial change every couple of years is a good way to run a successful club.

It felt like this summer heralded a new approach in the transfer market and a return to a more attacking United-like mentality on the pitch, which in turn means we as fans need to have a new approach in how we define our expectations for the next few seasons.

We were completely spoilt during the Fergie years. Winning that many trophies year in year out, for that long, is not normal. It was a freakish period of domination the like of which I doubt we'll see again. It was never going to last forever. We've had our time in the sun and now it's someone else's turn. It's just a shame that it happens to be City and Liverpool.

And Liverpool are a case in point. They were bang average for 25 years until Klopp arrived, and even when he did arrive he didn't win anything for the first 3 or 4 years. Yet the club and the fans stuck with him, and bought into what he was trying to achieve. That's turned out to be a great decision, and Liverpool are now realistically looking at winning the league for the first time in nearly 30 years.

I wonder whether they only stuck with Klopp because he was a name, whereas it might be more difficult for United fans to give Solskjaer the same lenience. Obviously the guy is a club legend, but his managerial career to date has not exactly been stellar.

You can't expect a guy to come in from Molde and automatically take a mid table squad to the title, or even the top four. We need to have realistic expectations and most importantly a bit of patience. Ole has clearly set out how he wants to play and the values he believes should run through a United team. We want a return to slick, attacking, exciting football and that's what he spent his whole career being a part of. I believe it will come but it won't happen overnight.

He is making steps in the right direction though. The signings of Maguire, Wan-Bissaka and James are all additions that improve the squad, and actually improve the starting line up too. They have probably been our three best players so far this season. By signing players that are young, hungry and most importantly, want to play for Manchester United Ole is moving away from the wasted years where we've chucked money at big names and expected trophies.

I think it will feel like two steps forward, one step back several times this season but I've accepted that, and I'm willing to give Ole the chance to build something. Pulling the trigger and changing it again now would be the wrong thing to do.
